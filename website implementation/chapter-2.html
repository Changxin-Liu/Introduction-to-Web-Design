			<p>I found a big container and filled it with a bit of water, then added the dried shit. Since then, I've added my own shit to it as well. The worse it smells, the more successful things are going. That's the bacteria at work!  </p>
            <p>Once I get some Martian soil in here, I can mix in the shit and spred it out. Then I can sprinkle the Earth soil on top. You might not think that would be an important step, but it is. There are dozens of species of bacteria living in the Earth soil, and they're critical to plant growth. They'll spread out and breed like... well, like a bacteria infection.</p>
            <p>The total floor-space of the Hab is about 92 square meters. I plan to dedicate all of it to this endeavor. I don't mind walking on dirt. It'll be a lot of work, but I'm going to need to cover the entire floor to a depth of 10 cm. That means I'll have to transport 9.2 cubic meters of Martian soil in to the Hab. I can get maybe 1/10th of a cubic meter in through the airlock at a time, and it'll be backbreaking work to collect it. But in the end, if everything goes to plan, I'll have 92 square meters of croppable soil.</p>
